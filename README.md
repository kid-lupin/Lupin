Lupin - Open Source Financial Audit Tools in R

This is the repository for all files related to the development of Lupin.
You can read the development blog at https://lupinfinancialaudittool.blogspot.com/

Lupin is an open source set of tools for use by financial auditors. Code will (at least initially) all be written in R. The blog explains the rationale for this project and how I've pulled it all together in my brains.

The aim is to produce a tool which any auditor with at least some data science skills will be able to produce a comprehensive analysis of an audited entity, predicated on the quality of the data obtained, and that the output analysis will be understandable by any other qualified auditor. The aim is to support the risk assessment process in accordance with the revised ISA 315.

Happy to hear from potential users with their view of their arduous adminstrative auditing activities.
